### About this Repo

Vodafone bootcamp project which was setup by our college to get a better grasp of python libraries

* PANDAS and NUMPY

Basically three datasets were given:
* `monthly_Revenue` 
* `Superstore` 
* `yearly_Revenue`

12 tasks were assigned to be completed using pandas and numpy functionalities

You can see all 12 tasks in the jupyter notebook uploaded named `Miniproject.ipynb`
